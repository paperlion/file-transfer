# file-transfer

This is robin's website, created by Spring and React.js from scratch. As my practicing project, this website doesn't have much function, but have a useful tool that allows your to transfer files any time and anywhere. It is times-unlimited and totally free. Be sure to try it. Never upload important files because I made no security measurement, nor mess with it because it is so weak.

In the end, thanks to Chris Z.'s, his website inspires me a lot. It is impossible for a rookie like me to finish a full-stack work without his open-source code.
